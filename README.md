# MRP_Project
   Develop a computer program that takes bill of material and the gross requirements of the end item along with the stock, scheduled receipt, arrival on week, lead time and lot sizing rule information of the subcomponents to create MRP records for all parts and components of the snow shovel. You are free to use any programming language with your peers from Computer Engineering department. However, the generated outputs of the designed code must exactly match the MRP record standards. Your code should be able to handle parent/child relationships, low level coding and interactions between parent and child components in terms of generating gross requirements for all subcomponents.
